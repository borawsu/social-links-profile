# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile

![Design preview for the Social links profile coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my project! 
In this readme file i described what i used to build this project and what helped me.

## Responsive web design

In the project i used CSS flexbox in order to make the site responsive.

It will change it's size and change it's properties according to the browser size.

## Styling

In this project i created 2 CSS stylesheets. 

1. styles.css - containing most style code
2. font.css - containing custom font 

### Useful sites

While doing this project i used few sites to get little help:

- https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp   -- helped to make elements change size when the browser width is smaller
- https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp   -- helped to make the site look like it should
- https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_box-shadow.php   -- helped to give a final touch to one of the elements
